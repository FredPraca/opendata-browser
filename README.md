This repository is just a test bed for my Angular and TypeScript tests using JSON data from [OpenData in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data_in_France).
There should be no real software emerging from this repository and if so, it would be totally unexpected :)

At the moment, works only by disabling Access-Control-Allow-Origin through browser plugin
